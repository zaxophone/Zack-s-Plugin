This plugin depends on Ionic.Zip which is distributed with the program but must be re-referred to in VS. Ionic should then be included with the plugin in the Plugins folder. AquaConsole will not recognise Ionic.Zip as a plugin.
There are no exceptions in this plugin so errors besides syntax will lead to an AquaConsole crash.
